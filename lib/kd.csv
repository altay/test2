kd/00-16 Still I Long For Your Kiss (Alternate Version) 1.mp3,Still I Long For Your Kiss (Alternate Version),Lucinda Williams,"You told me once that this was your favorite song on <em>Car Wheels</em>. Here's an alternate version for you.  It might not rock as hard, but I still think you'll like it."kd/01-10 Greenville 1.mp3,Greenville,Lucinda Williams,"When I hear this song, I think of that time when we were listening to it in your room in Cabot, and I pointed out how all the different instruments come in at different times to shape the song. You dug it. I liked showing you a new way to listen."kd/02-07 Essence.m4a,Essence,Lucinda Williams,Remember when we saw Lu in Providence and she drunkenly sang this? And you and I were dancing real close? I was so fucking turned on.kd/07-03 I Envy The Wind.m4a,I Envy The Wind,Lucinda Williams,"This song is so simple and beautiful. I like how, on each verse, the sound is reminiscent of what she's singing about. For example, on the verse about the rain, listen for the rhythmic, ""raindroppy"" guitar.  Also check out my favorite moment, when the pedal steel comes in while she sings ""I envy the sun....""  It sounds like heat!"kd/06-09 Crescent City.m4a,Crescent City,Lucinda Williams,"I love this song, and I especially like listening to this cover vs. the Emmylou one below. Lu's is darker, in large part cause the fiddle solo is over the chords from the chorus, which are minor, whereas Emmylou's fiddle solo is over the verse chords, which are major."kd/17-06 Crescent City.mp3,Crescent City,Emmylou Harris,See above.kd/03-06 Catch Yer Own Train.mp3,Catch Yer Own Train,The Silver Seas,"We saw these guys in Nashville. But you don't know the backstory. Becky put this on a mixtape for me a few months ago. (It's from the <em>Breaking Bad</em> soundtrack.) The other day, I asked a friend from Nashville for music tips for our trip, and he said ""You gotta check out my brother's band, The Silver Seas. They're playing on Friday. I'll get you on the list.""  Always leave room for serendipity, KD."kd/04-03 To Know You (Is To Love You).mp3,To Know You (Is To Love You),Anita Suhanin (w/Tyler Wood),"Remember Toad?  Remember Anita, who used to sing there? I recorded this track for her at Quad Sound (the studio in PfoHo). It was a present for her grandmother.  "kd/05-06 You Hit The Nail On The Head.mp3,You Hit The Nail On The Head,Arthur Adams,"What a fucking groove. Love the sound of the nail in the chorus. (""You hit the nail on the head [ding!]"") And the wah guitar solo. Badass."kd/08-04 Asking for Flowers.mp3,Asking for Flowers,Kathleen Edwards,"Becky recently turned me on to Kathleen Edwards. She wants Kathleen to be inspiration for our next album, the way that Lu was for the first one. I think you'd like this stuff."kd/09-02 Buffalo.mp3,Buffalo,Kathleen Edwards,"This one builds so well.  Love the piano.  Nice string arrangment, too.  Becky's inspiration for <em>Birmingham</em> (see below)."kd/10-04 Independent Thief.mp3,Independent Thief,Kathleen Edwards,You know what's sexy?

It's about a fucking drag race!kd/13-03 Way over Yonder in the Minor Key.mp3,Way over Yonder in the Minor Key,Billy Bragg with Wilco,Insanely catchy melody. It's interesting how they sing in unison (not harmonies) a lot of the time.kd/14-05 Born To Run.mp3,Born To Run,Bruce Springsteen,"Baby, we were born to run."kd/15-11 Medicine.mp3,Medicine,Cliff Murphy,I recorded Cliff's album in Quad Sound. I think this is a beautiful song.kd/20-12 Bay State Lullaby.mp3,Bay State Lullaby,Cliff Murphy,"Here's a sweet song to remind you of Boston.  It's another Cliff tune I recorded, featuring the Everybodyfields from Johnson City, TN. "kd/16-07 Ants Marching.mp3,Ants Marching,Dave Matthews Band,"Ok, I'm just fucking with you. Although, I will say, my first band covered this, and when I pulled out that fiddle and played that solo, it brought down the motherfucking house. (Or, rather, the motherfucking high school gymnasium.)  So I have a soft spot in my heart for it."kd/18-04 Violinkonzert e-moll. Allegro molto appassionato.mp3,Violinkonzert e-moll. Allegro molto appassionato,Felix Mendolssohn,"One day, after yoga, I want you to lie down, put your headphones on, close your eyes, and listen to this. (Apologies about the very end.  Wish I had a better recording.)"kd/19-01 look at miss ohio.mp3,Look at Miss Ohio,Gillian Welch,kd/22-15 I Heard It Through the Grapevine.mp3,I Heard It Through the Grapevine,Glady Knight and the Pips,"Do the eyes-closed, headphone-listening thing here, but focus on the bass.  I have listened to this song hundreds of times, and I still discover new nuances in this bass part. Unreal."kd/21-01 Midnight Train to Georgia.mp3,Midnight Train to Georgia,Glady Knight and the Pips,Something to remind you of Georgia.kd/21-2-04 Sunday In Savannah.mp3,Sunday in Savannah,Nina Simone,Another one.

Can you believe I played there? kd/25-A bad way.mp3,A Bad Way (demo),The Great Unknowns (demo),"A tune I'm working on with Becky. We're hoping to make it sound like an oldie, so I'm trying to write a Sam Cooke melody.""kd/26-Birmingham (with bass up, straight bridge).mp3",Birmingham (demo),The Great Unknowns (demo),Inspired by Kathleen Edwards' <em>Buffalo</em> and a big fight that Becky got into with the rest of the band when we were on tour in Birmingham.kd/27-I wish I was the girl I was.mp3,I wish I was the girl I was (demo),The Great Unknowns (demo),"Slammin' chorus.

Best part is the very end when he's all like, 'Packin' up my clothes, walkin' out the DOOR!' Damn straight, Woman."kd/38-01 Sick Of Myself.mp3,Sick Of Myself,Matthew Sweet,"You know I don't listen to lyrics, but for some reason I really connect with the lyrics on this record.
